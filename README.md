## Datasets
* [Overview](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes)
* [Indian Pine](https://purr.purdue.edu/publications/1947/1)
* [Data Fusion Contest 2018](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1474000?id=1474000)

## Why
Hyper-spectral imaging is a upcoming field that [has potential](https://www.cloudagronomics.com/technology) in the agriculture industry with many benefits including crop yield and carbon monitoring.

## Paper Review
* Rigor vs. Empirical - Balanced?
* Readability - Excellent
* Algorithm Difficulty - Low
* Pseudo Code - None / Step-Code?
* Hyperparameters Specified - Yes
* Compute Needed - GPU
* Number of Equations - 2
* Number of Tables - 5
Conclusion: We believe the paper is highly reproducible and very well documented. The only potential issue we foresee is within the preprocessing phase.
