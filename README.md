## Paper Notes
* Proposes a hybrid 3d and 2d model for general hyperspectral image(HSI) classification
* 3-D CNN: Employs principal component analysis on input data to reduce spatio-spectral images by its spectral bands(depth) in order to remove spatial redundancy
  - 3D convolution â†’ 3D kernel convolves on 3D-data(spatio-spectral image)
  - Uses 3d patches to determine image classification
  - 3D patches: overlapping spatio-spectral convolutions where the centered pixel is used for classification
  - Computationally expensive
  - Papers recommend 3 layered model to extract spectral features
    - One paper dubs this the Deep Metric Learning followed by a Conditional Random Field layer to make predictions
* 2-D CNN: Input data is convolved with 2d kernels(normal)
* Hybrid of both 3D and 2D Kernels are used for learning
  - Use of 3D convolutions to capture spatial data and 2D convolutions to decrease computational expense and learn non-spectral information (features of images for classification)
* Utilizes both spatio-spectral imaging in the form of 3-d convulsions and non spatio-spectral imaging in the form 2d convolutions
* This model also shows great performance with little data


Conclusion: We believe the paper is highly reproducible and very well documented. The only potential issue we foresee is within the preprocessing phase.
